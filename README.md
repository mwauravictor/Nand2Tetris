Repo for Elements of Computer Systems projects

I have long been interested in learning how computers actually work under the hood. After reading CODE by Charles Petzold, and drawing out the gates on paper, my craving for an actual machine running grew bigger. After some ressearch, I came across https://teachyourselfcs.com/ where Elements of Computer Systems is listed as a gentle introduction to Computer Architecture. I also found the course videos and software suite from which I can practice the concepts on. By the end of the course and book study, I hope to have understood and most importantly use that knowledge in real-world use.
